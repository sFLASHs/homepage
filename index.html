                                 ― I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by
                                 far. Nobody's ever been more successful than me. I'm the most
                                 successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me.
                                 Romney ― I have a Gucci store that's worth more than Romney. Sorry
                                 losers and haters, but my IQ is one of the highest ― and you all
                                 know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your
                                 fault.

                                 Started Trump University with Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny:
                                 no grades, certificates and other bureaucracy, but program offered
                                 courses in real estate, asset management entrepreneurship, and
                                 wealth creation. 98% students gave positive reviews while studying,
                                 however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits against
                                 Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to
                                 settle that...

                                 reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue. I sure do like my

                                 Started buying golf courses. They are very cheap, I have 18 of them
                                 now in USA and abroad! Also switched to the Reform Party that year

                                 Began a multi-building development along the Hudson River, which
                                 was named Trump Place. Me and the other investors sold our shares
                                 for $1.8 billion and that was then the biggest residential sale in

                                 Acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant
                                 seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive
                                 renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building

                                 turned it into a 44-story luxury property known as Trump
                                 International Hotel and Tower

                                 Ran a second hand airline called Trump Shuttle. What a waste of
                                 money, I had to sell it, now it is American Airlines Shuttle, btw

                                 Acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million, invested
                                 $50 million to restore the building and boosted it from three-star
                                 to four-star hotel (I called it "the Mona Lisa" and sold it for a
                                 lot of cash in 1995)

                                 I bought the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and turned it into a
                                 private club.You can join if you pay $200K initiation fee (and
                                 there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be
                                 rich). That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My
                                 wife Ivana became a manager, because she is another Trump!

                                 I purchased New Jersey Generals, an American football team. I
                                 changed team's play schedule and filed an antitrust lawsuit against
                                 United States Football League, so NJG are not doing so good now,
                                 but back then they were great!

                                 Started developing the Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan, I payed
                                 a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic
                                 Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make
                                 architectural critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's
                                 atrium is "the most pleasant interior public space to be completed
                                 in New York in some years". At the same time I also started a
                                 repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and completed the
                                 work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less
                                 than the initial budget!
